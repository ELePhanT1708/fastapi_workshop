# fastapi_workshop



This repo contains a good-strucutured FASTAPI project , separate folders for services, models, api_routers.

This project educated me for creating well-strucutured projects in FastAPI. How to reuse block of code from different places and to select more appropriate names for variables.

USEFUL tips from this repo : 

- Creating different model classes for creating , updating , and another operations to use 100% of capacity of Pydantic validation

- Export some data to csv file locally , was implemented opportunity to download your history of opertions to your computer as csv file , and kinda cool 

- Also description as tags for metadata and description about naming this API and version of API , details but cool , I think

- For separate routing files all endpoints were filtered by functuonality tooo, all operations together , all user actions together , and it's great
